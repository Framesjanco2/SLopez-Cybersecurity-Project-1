## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod g-r shadow     (to remove read access from group in my case)

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l gshadow		

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod g-r gshadow    (to remove read access from group in my case)

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): not needed in my case

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:ls -l passwd 

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): not needed in my case

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): sudo adduser (sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin) then add password

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo adduser admin sudo

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo adduser <name> engineers

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir engineers 

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:  sudo chgrp engineers engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt-get install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: lynis -help

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

    - Screenshot of report output:  Warnings (4):
